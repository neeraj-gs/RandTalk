A Real Time Chat App 
    CLients get connected with a scoket connection with our sever 
        we can do real time comunication using the app 
        This can never be sacled up if teh number of users are increasing

    If 2 diffretn servers are used and 2 users on  difretn server then commnication is not possible betewen diffrent servers, so we solve that problem 

Aiven - Data Platform running on , adn all services are presetn , to use redis we use aiven platform 
we connect the servers to aiven and use Pub/Sub Architecture , intermidiate pubsub mecahnism


MOno repo - we can have our backend , frontend and platform or databade in a single repo adn to mange it we use turbo repo


Main Logic
    Listen to events on SOcket and also sync it with redis 
    IN a CHat message app , as a user we emit events[send events or todo to server] ,
    We can also subscribe to events, that means that it is the reciever of the event , and subscribed gets recieved the ,essage
